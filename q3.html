            <h2> Old Fashion Typesetting </h2>
            <p> In the early days of printing, typesetting was a meticulous and labor-intensive process. Typesetters
                manually arranged individual blocks of type, each representing a letter or symbol, to create the layout
                of a
                page. The process was slow but yielded high-quality results, with each letter precisely aligned for
                maximum
                readability </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2> Desktop Publishing </h2>
            <p> The advent of computers, <strong> desktop publishing </strong> revolutionized the way layouts were
                designed. Unlike traditional typesetting, desktop publishing allowed users to arrange text, images, and
                other elements on
                the page using software. This sped up production and enabled more flexibility and creativity in design.

        <section>
            <h2> HTML & CSS </h2>
            <p> With the rise of the web, HTML and CSS emerged as essential tools for digital publishing. HTML provides
                the
                structure, while CSS adds styling, offering a separation of content and design. Unlike traditional
                typesetting or even desktop publishing, changes to styling in CSS can be applied site-wide, making it
                incredibly efficient for large-scale websites </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2> Comparison </h2>
            <p> While traditional typesetting required painstaking manual work, desktop publishing introduced automation
                and
                flexibility, greatly reducing time and labor. HTML and CSS further enhance this by offering a scalable
                solution for digital content. However, typesetting offered unparalleled control over each element, a
                feature
                that's sometimes lost in modern automated methods. Each method has its strengths, with older techniques
                emphasizing precision and newer technologies focusing on speed and flexibility.</p>
