    <h1> Empahsized & strengthened text</h1>
    <p> This is an example of <em> empahsized text</em> and some <strong> strong text </strong> to highlight some
        important information</p>

        <h2>...Separating content from presentation</h2>
        <h3> Explanation</h3>
        <p>the use of <strong>strong </strong> and <em> emphasis</em> tags is a better choice than <b> bold </b> and <i>
                italic </i> tags because they provide semantic meaning to the content. While <strong> strong </strong>
            highlights importance content, and <em> emphasizes </em> it, while <b> bold </b> and <i> italic </i> only
            change visual appearance. Screen readers recognize <strong> strong </strong> and <em> emphasis </em> and
            convey their importance, improving the experience for visually impaired users.This makes them more
            meaningful than the purely stylistic <b>bold </b>and <i>italic</i> tags.
